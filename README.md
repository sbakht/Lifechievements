###Another todolist app

You can view the site here https://glowing-torch-9570.firebaseapp.com

This is a video game trophy/achievement take on todo lists. Its generally suppose to be used for tasks that need to be completed multiple times such as "Do 100 pushups". Every time you do some number of pushups, you mark your progress and the achievement is moved to the completed list once you reach 100 pushups. 

The site has a demo so you can try all the features without having to create an account to save your achievements.
